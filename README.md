# Claudex v2

> Infinite context, persistent memory, and structural enforcement for Claude Code.

## What is Claudex?

Claudex is a hook-based memory and context system for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). It intercepts every session lifecycle event -- session start, prompt submission, tool use, compaction, and session end -- to automatically capture observations, preserve reasoning chains, and inject relevant context back into the conversation. The result is persistent memory across sessions: Claude Code gains awareness of past decisions, recently touched files, and project-specific knowledge, even after context compaction wipes the conversation window.

The system operates entirely through Claude Code's hook protocol. Six hooks feed into a SQLite database with FTS5 full-text search, a Python TCP sidecar for pressure-based attention routing, and a flat-file mirror that keeps all data human-readable. When any component is unavailable, the system degrades gracefully through three tiers -- never crashing, never blocking the user.

## Architecture

          consensus)
```

**Components:**

- **6 Hook Entry Points** -- one per Claude Code lifecycle event, bundled as standalone `.mjs` files via esbuild
- **SQLite Storage** with WAL mode -- observations, sessions, reasoning chains, consensus decisions, pressure scores
- **FTS5 Full-Text Search** across all tables with auto-sync triggers and BM25 ranking
- **Hologram Sidecar** -- a long-lived Python TCP server communicating via NDJSON protocol for pressure-based file attention scoring
- **Three-Tier Degradation** -- hologram -> DB pressure scores -> recency fallback (system never crashes)
- **Flat-File Mirroring** -- every DB record mirrored to human-readable markdown files
- **Context Assembler** -- priority-ranked, token-budgeted context injection into Claude's input
- **Wrapper Layer** -- context window monitoring with configurable warn/flush thresholds

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- Python 3.x (for hologram sidecar)

### Installation

```bash
cd Claudex
npm install
npm run build
```

This produces 6 `.mjs` hook bundles in `dist/`:

| Hook                 | File                           | Trigger                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| SessionStart         | `dist/session-start.mjs`       | Session begins (startup/resume)  |
| SessionEnd           | `dist/session-end.mjs`         | Session ends                     |
| UserPromptSubmit     | `dist/user-prompt-submit.mjs`  | User submits a prompt            |
| PostToolUse          | `dist/post-tool-use.mjs`       | After a tool call completes      |
| PreCompact           | `dist/pre-compact.mjs`         | Before context compaction        |
| UserPromptSubmit (2) | `dist/pre-flush.mjs`           | Context window monitoring        |

### Hook Registration

Add the following to your Claude Code `settings.json` (typically `~/.claude/settings.json`).

**Windows** -- the `hooks/` directory contains `.cmd` wrappers:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "C:\\path\\to\\Claudex\\hooks\\session-start.cmd" }]
      }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "C:\\path\\to\\Claudex\\hooks\\session-end.cmd" }]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "C:\\path\\to\\Claudex\\hooks\\user-prompt-submit.cmd" },
          { "type": "command", "command": "C:\\path\\to\\Claudex\\hooks\\pre-flush.cmd" }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "C:\\path\\to\\Claudex\\hooks\\post-tool-use.cmd" }]
      }
    ],
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "C:\\path\\to\\Claudex\\hooks\\pre-compact.cmd" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `C:\path\to\Claudex` with the actual path to the `Claudex/` directory.

**Unix / macOS** -- the `hooks/` directory contains `.sh` wrappers. Make them executable first:

```bash
chmod +x hooks/*.sh
```

Then register in `settings.json` using the same structure, replacing `.cmd` paths with `.sh`:

```
/path/to/Claudex/hooks/session-start.sh
```

## Configuration

### ~/.claudex/config.json

All configuration is optional. Missing keys fall back to defaults. A missing or corrupt file uses all defaults.

```json

    "health_interval_ms": 30000
  },
  "database": {
    "path": "~/.claudex/db/claudex.db",
    "wal_mode": true
  },
  "hooks": {
    "latency_budget_ms": 3000
  },
  "observation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "redact_secrets": true,

  },
  "wrapper": {

### ~/.claudex/projects.json

The project registry maps working directories to named projects. Claudex uses this to scope observations, pressure scores, and context injection per project.

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "my-project": {
      "path": "C:\\Users\\me\\Projects\\my-project",
      "status": "active"
    },
    "another-project": {
      "path": "/home/me/projects/another-project",
      "status": "active"
    }
  }
}
```

When `cwd` falls within a registered project path, Claudex enters project scope -- observations are tagged with the project name, search results are filtered by project, and flat-file mirrors write into `<project_path>/context/`. If `cwd` doesn't match any registered project, Claudex operates in global scope.

## Hooks

### 1. session-start

**Trigger:** Session begins (startup, resume, or clear).

- Bootstraps the `~/.claudex/` directory tree (idempotent)
- Detects scope via `projects.json` lookup
- Registers the session in `sessions/index.json` and SQLite
- Restores context from prior sessions: queries observations, reasoning chains, consensus decisions, and pressure scores from DB
- Queries the hologram sidecar for live pressure scores (falls back to DB scores, then empty)
- Assembles and injects restored context via `additionalContext`

### 2. session-end

**Trigger:** Session ends (clear, logout, or prompt exit).

Five independent sections, each with isolated error handling:

- Captures a final transcript snapshot to `~/.claudex/transcripts/<session_id>/`
- Checks for a completion marker (`.completed-<session_id>`) to distinguish clean vs. unclean exits
- Writes a fail-safe auto-handoff file if no completion marker exists and scope is project
- Updates session status in `sessions/index.json` and SQLite
- Persists hologram pressure scores to DB for cross-session continuity
- Writes a session summary markdown file

### 3. user-prompt-submit

**Trigger:** User submits a prompt.

- Skips injection for short prompts (< 10 characters)
- Detects scope and retrieves recent observations from DB
- Queries the hologram sidecar for pressure-scored file context (with resilient retry and three-tier degradation)
- Queries FTS5 for observations matching prompt keywords (auto-extracted, stop words filtered)
- Assembles context from all sources within a 4000-token budget
- Injects assembled context via `additionalContext`

### 4. post-tool-use

**Trigger:** After every tool call completes.

- Respects `observation.enabled` config gate
- Extracts structured observations from tool I/O (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebFetch)
- Applies secret redaction (API keys, tokens, JWTs, AWS keys)
- Filters trivial operations (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`)
- Stores observations in SQLite and mirrors to flat-file daily markdown
- Returns empty output (never injects context)

### 5. pre-compact

**Trigger:** Before context compaction (auto or manual).

- Copies the transcript file to `~/.claudex/transcripts/<session_id>/` with SHA256 checksum and metadata
- Captures the tail of the transcript as a reasoning chain and stores it in SQLite
- Writes a flat-file mirror of the reasoning chain markdown

### 6. pre-flush

**Trigger:** Runs on every UserPromptSubmit (piggybacks as a second hook on the same event).

- Gated behind `wrapper.enabled` config
- Reads token counts from hook input
- Assesses utilization against warn/flush thresholds
- Respects file-based cooldown (survives across ephemeral hook processes)
- Executes the flush sequence: persist pressure scores, write flat-file mirrors, request hologram re-score

## Degradation Tiers

The system is designed to never crash, regardless of which components are available:

| Tier | Name             | Condition                              | Behavior                                                       |
|------|------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Full Stack       | Hologram sidecar running + responsive  | Live pressure-scored context (HOT/WARM/COLD file classification) |
| 2    | DB Pressure      | Hologram unavailable, DB has scores    | Uses persisted pressure scores from previous hologram queries  |
| 3    | Recency Fallback | No hologram + no DB scores             | Recently-touched files from observations, classified as WARM   |

The `ResilientHologramClient` implements this chain: attempt query, retry once, fall back to DB pressure scores, fall back to recency. Every DB function catches errors internally and returns empty results. Every hook exits 0 regardless of internal failures.

## Storage

### SQLite Database (~/.claudex/db/claudex.db)

The database uses WAL mode for concurrent reads, with 4 sequential migrations applied automatically on every connection:

**Tables:**

| Table                 | Migration | Purpose                                          |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `observations`        | 1         | Auto-captured tool use observations              |
| `sessions`            | 1         | Session lifecycle tracking                       |
| `reasoning_chains`    | 3         | Flow reasoning snapshots preserved across compaction |
| `consensus_decisions` | 3         | Three-way (Claude/Codex/human) agreement records |
| `pressure_scores`     | 3         | Hologram attention scores with decay             |
| `observations_fts`    | 2         | FTS5 virtual table for observation search        |
| `reasoning_fts`       | 4         | FTS5 virtual table for reasoning search          |
| `consensus_fts`       | 4         | FTS5 virtual table for consensus search          |
| `schema_versions`     | --        | Migration tracking                               |

FTS5 tables use content-sync mode with auto-sync triggers (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). All tables support BM25-ranked search with snippet extraction. A unified `searchAll()` function merges results across all three FTS5 tables.

Pressure scores use a `UNIQUE(file_path, project)` index with a `__global__` sentinel for global scope (avoids NULL uniqueness issues in SQLite).

### Vector Search Abstraction

The `FTS5VectorStore` class wraps FTS5 search behind a `VectorStore` interface (`search`, `searchByTable`). This abstraction layer allows future replacement with real vector search providers (OpenAI embeddings, local models) without changing consumer code. Currently FTS5 is the only implemented backend.

### Flat-File Mirrors

Every record stored in SQLite is also mirrored to human-readable markdown files. The human is never locked out of their own data.

| Data Type           | Global Scope Path                                        | Project Scope Path                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Observations        | `~/.claudex/memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`                 | `<project>/context/observations/YYYY-MM-DD.md`          |
| Reasoning Chains    | `~/.claudex/reasoning/<session_id>/<timestamp>.md`       | `<project>/context/reasoning/<session_id>/<timestamp>.md`|
| Consensus Decisions | `~/.claudex/consensus/<session_id>/<timestamp>.md`       | `<project>/context/consensus/<session_id>/<timestamp>.md`|
| Pressure Scores     | `~/.claudex/pressure/scores.md`                         | `<project>/context/pressure/scores.md`                   |
| Transcripts         | `~/.claudex/transcripts/<session_id>/<timestamp>.jsonl`  | (same)                                                   |
| Session Summaries   | `~/.claudex/sessions/<session_id>/summary.md`            | (same)                                                   |

Observations are append-only. Pressure scores are snapshot (overwritten each time). Reasoning and consensus are written as individual files.

## Hologram Sidecar

The hologram sidecar is a long-lived Python TCP server (`sidecar/server.py`) that communicates with hooks via NDJSON over localhost TCP. It is designed to outlive individual hook processes (hooks are ephemeral -- one process per event).

**Protocol:** Each TCP connection carries one request/response pair as newline-delimited JSON:

| Request Type | Purpose                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `query`      | Get pressure-scored file context         |
| `ping`       | Health check (returns `pong`)            |
| `update`     | Notify file changes for recalculation    |
| `shutdown`   | Graceful shutdown                        |

**Lifecycle management** (`SidecarManager`):
- Lazy-starts the sidecar on first query
- Detects and reuses existing sidecar processes via PID/port files
- Cleans up orphaned processes and stale port files
- Verifies sidecar identity via NDJSON ping (distinguishes from foreign processes on the same port)
- Port file: `~/.claudex/db/hologram.port`; PID file: `~/.claudex/db/hologram.pid`

**Current state:** The sidecar server is operational and responds to all protocol messages. The hologram-cognitive pressure engine is not yet integrated -- queries return empty pressure arrays, causing the system to degrade to Tier 2 (DB pressure) or Tier 3 (recency fallback) as designed.

## Context Assembly

The context assembler (`src/lib/context-assembler.ts`) builds injection payloads from multiple sources into a token-budgeted markdown string. Sections are appended in priority order, each only if it fits within the remaining budget:

1. **Identity** (agent/user context)
2. **Project** (primer, handoff)
3. **HOT files** (pressure >= 0.851)
4. **Flow Reasoning** (reasoning chains from prior compactions)
5. **Related Observations** (FTS5 search results ranked by BM25)
6. **Consensus Decisions** (three-way agreement records)
7. **Session Continuity** (post-compaction marker)
8. **WARM files** (pressure >= 0.426)
9. **Recent Activity** (fallback when no hologram and no FTS5 results)

Token estimation uses a simple `ceil(length / 4)` heuristic. The default budget is 4000 tokens.

## Observation Extraction

The observation extractor (`src/lib/observation-extractor.ts`) transforms raw tool I/O into structured `Observation` objects. Each observation includes a category, importance score (1-5), file references, and content.

**Handled tools:** Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebFetch.

**Secret redaction** is applied to all observation titles and content, matching:
- API keys, tokens, passwords, credentials
- Stripe/service keys (`sk-*`, `pk-*`, etc.)
- GitHub personal access tokens (`ghp_*`, `gho_*`, etc.)
- JWT tokens
- AWS access key IDs

**Filtering:** Trivial bash commands (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`) are silently dropped. Glob results with fewer than 3 matches are dropped.

### Key Design Principles

- **Never throw from hooks.** Every hook exits 0 and returns valid JSON to stdout, regardless of internal errors. Logging captures failures for debugging.
- **Never throw from DB functions.** All database operations catch errors internally and return empty/default results. Errors are logged, not propagated.
- **Fail open.** If the hologram is down, use DB scores. If the DB is down, use recency. If everything is down, return empty context and let Claude work normally.
- **Hooks are ephemeral.** Each hook invocation is a fresh Node.js process. Module-level state resets every time. Cross-invocation state uses the filesystem (cooldown files, port/PID files) or SQLite.
- **The sidecar is long-lived.** Spawned detached, outlives hook processes. Port/PID files coordinate discovery. Orphan detection cleans up stale state.
- **Timestamps are always milliseconds.** `timestamp_epoch` fields throughout the codebase are epoch milliseconds, not seconds.
